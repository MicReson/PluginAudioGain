# Audio Plugin Gain (WIP)

## Using JUCE framework to make a gain plugin

Creating a simple gain plugin in VST3 and AU formats, it can be use in any DAW (except Pro Tools due to not supporting AAX). This project was created from the start with CMake, trying to avoid the use of the Porjucer, opening the use of any other IDE and not just the IDEs that are supported by the Projucer.

### TODO:
- Improve look of the plugin.
- Get better and easier to read font.
- Doble check the look and feel of the slider.
